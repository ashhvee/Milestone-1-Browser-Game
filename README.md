ParaDIE -
This is a simple run n' jump platformer game.
Only HTML, CSS, and JS have been used to create this browser game.
More developments and improvements will be made to the game in the near future.

Your objective is to jump over the obstacles until you reach the finish line.
Coming into contact with an obstacle will result in a loss and the game will restart.

The character will run on its own.
Left-click anywhere on the screen to make the character jump.
